# JavaScript DOM Games — 100 Games (By Chapter)

This repo is organized **by chapter** (4 games per chapter, 100 total).

- Open `index.html` to launch the chapter list.
- Each chapter has its own `index.html` that links to the 4 games for that chapter.
- Each game is a self-contained folder with an `index.html`.

## Notes
Some games are already implemented (from the starter packs you generated earlier).  
Any missing games include a **placeholder** `index.html` you can replace with the final build.
